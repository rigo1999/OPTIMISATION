## Key Features

### Unconstrained Optimization

- **4 algorithms** implemented from scratch
- **Rosenbrock test function** included (classic benchmark)
- **Line search** with Armijo condition for step size selection
- **BFGS** uses quasi-Newton approximation (no Hessian needed)
- All methods converge correctly on test problems

### Constrained Optimization

- **3 main algorithms** for constrained problems
- **Flexible constraint system** supporting:
  - Inequality constraints (g(x) ≤ 0)
  - Equality constraints (h(x) = 0)
  - Multiple constraints simultaneously
- **Box projection** utility for bound constraints
- Penalty parameter adaptation for numerical stability

## Test Results

All tests pass successfully:

```
Test 1: Optimisation sans contrainte
✓ BFGS: Solution converges to (0, 0) with f* ≈ 0
✓ Gradient Descent: Converges correctly
✓ Conjugate Gradient: Converges correctly
✓ BFGS (Rosenbrock): Solution converges to (1, 1)

Test 2: Optimisation avec contraintes
✓ Penalty Method: Satisfies constraints within tolerance
✓ Augmented Lagrangian: Satisfies constraints within tolerance
✓ Projected Gradient: Maintains feasibility
✓ Constraint types: equality and inequality both work

Test 3: Fonction de projection
✓ Projection functions work correctly
```
